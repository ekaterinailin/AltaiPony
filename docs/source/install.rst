Quickstart
=======================================

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

::
    
    git clone https://github.com/ekaterinailin/AltaiPony.git
    cd AltaiPony
    python setup.py install

This package depends, on `lightkurve`, `k2sc`, `numpy`, `pandas` and some other packages, most of which will be installed automatically. Have a look at `requirements.txt` in the repository to see a more extensive list.
   

Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Working with Kepler and TESS light curves is similar, K2 light curves need extra love, so we treat them separately. For each mission, there is a notebook that will guide you through the basic applications.

Kepler Light Curves
...................

If you are working with ``KeplerLightCurve`` objects, i.e. light curves from the original Kepler mission, try this_ notebook. This shows how to fetch a light curve from MAST, de-trend it with a Savitzky-Golay_ filter from scipy_, and find some flares.

TESS Light Curves
...................

If you are working with ``TessLightCurve`` objects, i.e. light curves from the TESS mission, you may want to try this other_ notebook instead. In this one, you can also test the injection recovery feature of **AltaiPony**, and obtain recovery probability and a corrected equivalent duration (*ED*, aka luminosity independent flare energy).

K2 Light Curves
...................

If you are working with ``KeplerLightCurve`` objects, i.e. light curves from the K2 mission, this last notebook_ is for you. It will run **k2sc**'s GP de-trending and find flares in a typical K2 long cadence light curve despite its heavy instrumental artifacts.
