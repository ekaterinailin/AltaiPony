De-trending Light Curves
========================

AltaiPony currently features three different de-trending aproaches that aim at removing astrophysical and instrumental trends in the time series while preserving the flares.

Call the de-trender on a ``FlareLightCurve`` with 

::
   
     detrended_flc = flc.detrend(<detrending method>, **kwargs)


For <detrending method> you can pass one the following:

- "k2sc" - if you wish to de-trend a K2 light curve, this is the best way to deal with, among other issues in K2, the Kepler spacecraft roll (see [1]_, [2]_ and [3]_ for details)
- "savgol" - applies a Savitky-Golay [4]_ filter to the light curve. This method is quick and gives good results in both Kepler and TESS light curves, but you may have to play with the "window_length" keyword to get optimal results
- "custom" - you can use your own de-trending pipeline. Pass a function that takes a ``FlareLightCurve`` and returns a FlareLightCurve to `flc.detrend("custom", func=<your custom de-trending function>)`. One such function is currently accessible via `altaipony.detrend.custom_detrending`, and will be documented in detail soon (Ilin+2021 in prep.).
